## TimescaleDB Python Module and DB schema

*This repository is mainly for demonstration purpose, or for first level design of database schema for incorporating datastreams from sources.*

The repository includes timescaledb.py, which can be used to automatically create the DB schema for timescaleDB on a remote server, and testdb.yaml which has the information of all the necessary credentials, hostname and database names for data injection and processing.
